###  Color palette

#### :heavy_check_mark:  Consider brand personality 
Our brand is focused on **energy and motivation**, brigther colors such as orange and red may be more suiteable.

#### :heavy_check_mark:  Keep it simple
A color palette with too many colors can be confusing. I will limit color pallete to two main colors and two complementary. :heavy_check_mark:

| Priority of color | Value of color |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Primary   | #992734       |
| Secondary   | #f4ae44 |
| Tertiary(complementary)   | #ed4143 |
| Complementary   | #ffffff |

If audience is primarily women, consider more softer colors. If audience is more focused on strength and power, more vibrant colors may be more effective.
